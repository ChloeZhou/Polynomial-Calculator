# Polynomial-Calculator
This project include three pieces of codes- the Polynomial class, Term class and PolynomialCalculator class.

Polynomial Calculator is a command-based program that lets you manipulate polynomials.My program will initially create an array of 10 polynomials whose initial value is the zero polynomial. The user will be able to manipulate any of these polynomials by giving the commands shown by the user interface. The arguments to the commands are indices of this array.

The Polynomial class create a polynomial. Polynomials can be added together, evaluated, and converted to a string form for printing.

Term class create one term of a polynomial: (coeff, expon). Notice that exponents must be non-negative. This class is immutable.
